# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard that user that takes an user's input and outputs the current weather details along with a 5-day forecast. Under the search bar each city in the history will be appended as buttons that can be clicked for their details once more.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Technologies Used
 * JavaScript 
 * HTML 
 * CSS 
 * Bootstrap
 * Current Weather Data API
 * One Call API 

## Challenges Faced
Icons were only present on the the first day of the forecast and on the current day's forecast. The weather dot notation on line #129 incorrectly had the i variable in the index position. Once a value of 0 replaced the i variable the images would be displayed.

## Future Refactoring
Make mobile friendly and add a remove button to previously searched cities.

## Result

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
